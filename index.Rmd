# Downstream retail pricing

.pull-left[
Provide evidence on effective price of a manufacturers *own* product.

* Alcolin and Checkers agree to work together
* Checkers says we will sell it at retail price of R39.99 and special of R29.99 during 'back to school' for two weeks.
* Alcolin agrees with Checkers on unit price of R20
* `trundler` shows that Checkers only had special on for one week
* Alcolin can bargain for higher unit price.

Like [pricecheck](https://www.pricecheck.co.za/), but better?

* My granny would use it - she's very price sensitive!

* Pricecheck looks like trash now, why?

* Pushback from supermarkets?

# CCSA investigation aid

.pull-left[

Aid during CCSA investigations.

* CCSA asks parties involved to provide their own data during discovery

* Third parties are asked by CCSA to cooperate - they can refuse if it is going to be too difficult.

* Even when third parties do provide information - it's all jumbled and hard to compare!

* `trundler` could be the tool to use! Comparable and detailed historical pricing data would be ideal.

### Addition to StatsSA's P0141 - Consumer Price Index (CPI)???

Stats SA has got some problems - maybe these indexed pricing reports as a service could be useful to them?
